# Shadow Cannon

**Shadow Cannon** is a strategic game based on physics and precision, developed in Python using the Kivy framework. The game was created by **Claudia Maria Carboni** and **Susanna Mazzocchi** as a project for the Programming course, BSc in Artificial Intelligence.

## Game Description

As the last Master of the Shadow Cannon, the player must navigate through four thematic levels, each with unique gameplay mechanics and obstacles. The goal is to hit the target using different types of projectiles, overcoming obstacles, and leveraging the laws of physics to complete the levels as quickly as possible.

### Levels:
1. **Hell**: Introduction to basic mechanics with parabolic projectiles and destructible obstacles.
2. **Abyss**: Introduction of the shotgun and bats, requiring different strategies.
3. **Cursed Lands**: Introduction of the laser and mirrors, which reflect the projectile.
4. **Space**: Final level with two types of lasers and asteroids to destroy.

## Key Features

- **Four levels** with progressive difficulty.
- **Three types of projectiles**: Bomb, Shotgun, and Laser.
- **Collision system** based on bounding boxes.
- **Hall of Fame** to store the best completion times.
- **Intuitive user interface** with visual and audio feedback.
- **Thematic background music** for each section of the game.

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.12.0**
- **Kivy 2.3.1**
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, Linux
